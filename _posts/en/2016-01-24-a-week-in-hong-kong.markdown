We already wrote about our <a href='/2016/01/18/first-day-in-hong-kong/'>first day in Hong Kong</a>. What we didn't say was that day when we went to sleep we barely slept a couple of hours, and at 2am HK time we were completely awake and couldn't sleep again. We tried really hard to convince our bodies that it was night, and no matter how much we kept our eyes shut, we couldn't convince our body that it was time to sleep. I think that if when we were in Caracas, I had tried at noon to close my eyes so persistently I would have fallen sleep without any troubles, but in this case that wasn't working.

## Second Day
After making breakfast we went first thing in the morning to the Thailand Embassy, to get our visa (<a href='/2016/01/20/how-to-get-the-thai-visa/'>How to get the Thai Visa in Hong Kong</a>), after which we searched for a place with good internet connection that allowed us to do some work. We choose the Hong Kong Public Library at City Hall, which was pretty close to the Thailand Embassy. A public library is a good place to do some work, confortable chairs and tables, silent people and a good internet connection make it a good option for digital nomads.

Around 2pm we were already starving, and decided to find a nice, cheap and good place to eat (in Venezuela we say: "Bueno, bonito y barato"). As always we went by the TripAdvisor reviews, and we choose _Tsim Chai Kee Noodles_.

One of the great advantages of modern technology is that both Google Maps and TripAdvisor apps for smartphones allow you to download maps and information to use it offline, which is definetely very useful to travellers. Having this applications we were able to get to our chosen place to eat very quickly.

The place was very crowded with tourists and locals, they only sell Hong Kong noodles in three varietes: meat, fish and shrimp wanton, or any combination of those. Gabriela chose the meat noodles, and I got a combination of fish and wanton. The noodles were really good, and the serving size was big enough. Luckily for us the prices were also within our budget, just HK$28 for the simple dish and HK$34 for the combination, which is almost USD 3.6 and 4.4.

After eating we walked around a little bit before taking the Ferry to cross Hong Kong Bay to the Kowloon Peninsula, where we were staying. Taking the Ferry allowed us to enjoy the views of the city from the Bay we had enjoyed the previous night, but this time by day.

Despite being only 6pm we were already fighting our urges to sleep, so we decided to go again to see the Light Show by the Bay to try to gain some time and avoid going to sleep so early, just to try to regularize our schedule. With a great effort we were able to resist until 8pm to see the light show again. I have to admit that I don't remember this second time as well as the first, maybe because if you watch the light show two days in a row it is not as impressive anymore, o maybe because despite having my eyes open I was really sleeping half of the show.

After watching the light show we went back to the appartment and felt asleep inmediately without even having dinner. That didn't help in our fight against Jetlag, but it was an unavoidable consecuence of fighting the urge to sleep for so long.

## The rest of the week
Not even going to bed at 9m was enough to avoid waking up at 3am. Smartphones don't help either. After half an hour without being able to sleep is almost impossible to avoid reaching for your phone to check twitter, facebook, instagram, whatsapp, the news, and then again facebook. Without even noticing it, it is already 8 in the morning again.

After having breakfast we went to get our passports and again to <a href="https://www.hkpl.gov.hk/en/locations/central-and-western/library/city-hall.html" target="_blank" >our office</a> where we stayed until luch time. As always we went by the TripAdvisors reviews, but this time we weren't so lucky. We choose a place that doesn't exist anymore (remember to always check how old are the last reviews before deciding for a place) and we were so hungry by the time that we ended up eating on the first place we crossed that had a lot of people and that was cheap enough for us. The place was called "Yummy" and served steamed rice with saucy meats that were good but not great.

After eating we went back to the office, and around 5pm I see Gabriela falling sleep over her laptop. That is when I suggest to go back to the appartment, which we did, and as soon as we got there we went to sleep setting the alarm clock at 9pm to go for dinner. What a lie, we woke up at 4am, and ended up doing the same than the previous night.

The next day we went to a public library closer to the appartment, and choose it as our new office for the next two days. Because it was close to where we were staying we could go back at noon to have a quick lunch and use the groceries we bought on our first day, which so far were almost completely unused from having skiped dinner so much, and from so much eating out.

On thursday the rain and the cold made it really difficult to enjoy a walk around the city. Our luck was that Asia was experiencing the strongest cold wave in 15 years. In the afternoon we went to the Hong Kong History Museum, which has exhibitions going from pre-history to modern history, however we were just able to get until the Opium Wars and the ceding of Hong Kong to Great Britain before the museum closed. On our way back to the appartment we went by one of the numerous bakeries that abound around the city, and we felt to the temptation and bought some sweet breads, which on the good side allowed us to have dinner for the first time before going to sleep.

Dinner, however, didn't help us to sleep longer, we ended up waking up again at 4 in the morning. It wasn't any help either that the bed was so hard that it hurted no matter how you tried to sleep on it. Maybe sleeping on the floor could have been better, we thought about that option but ended up discarding it because it was too cold, colder than on the bed. Friday wasn't to different from Thursday, we went to the public library, had some lunch at the appartment, and prepared our bags to move the next day, after which we decided to take a "siesta" that ended up at 6am the next morning. Finally our first complete night of sleep of the whole week.

## The weekend
Early on saturday we moved to an appartment located close to the Prince Edwards MTR station, where our <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/ealvarado?s=8">AirBnB</a> host was a young french man very nice and talkative. He had been living in Hong Kong only for 4 months, and he also spoke very goood spanish because he had also lived in Spain for 5 years. This was a more authentic AirBnB experience, a homely appartment with a bed so soft that we wanted to stay sleeping the whole day.

Despite the soft bed, we decided to go out because it wasn't raining. We went to visit some temples around Kowloon, we visited the _Chi Lin Nunnery_, a working monastery with a beutiful inner yard, and in front of which is the _Nan Lian Garden_. Both places look like an oasis in the middle of the city skyscrappers. After that we went to the _Won Tai Sin_ temple, which is an active temple, more traditional, where a lot of people goes to do their offerings and burn inciense and fake money. It was a wonderful experience, and shows that in China religious beliefs are taken seriously even in the new generations.

After having a regular lunch at the _Temple Mall_ food court (just next to the _Won Tai Sin_ temple), we took the public bus to go to the _Victoria Peak_. The tram that goes there is one of the main touristic attractions from Hong Kong, and the preferred way for tourist to go up, but both Gabriela and I had used it a couple of times before, and this time we decided to save some money by using the bus. Traveling for one year requires a different kind of mentality than a one month holiday, specially budget wise. We took bus number 15 which goes through some pretty step and curvy roads with great views to the city.

Every time we visited before this we stayed at the _Ngong Ping 360_ which is a paid platform with views to the city included in the price of the Tram. This time, and thanks to Google Maps, we found out that the real _Victoria Peak_ is almost one kilometer higher up, so we decided to walk there and have a better view. The walk also allowed us to see both sides of the island, and helped us warm up a bit despite the cold. In our way back we also went to the free platform on the _Peak Gallery_ which is just in front of the tram station and has a lot less tourists but the same view. However, it was so cold and windy that we couldn't stay outside for long, so we went back to the city and again took the Ferry, which though slower that going by the MTR, it has an spectacular view of the city by night.

After getting back to Kowloon we went to eat again to the _DimDimSum Dim Sum Specialty Store_ in Jordan, where we ate our first night, but this time we got different dishes. This was the night of fried dishes, we ate a delicious _Gyozas_, fried Wonton, and Wasabi stuffed fried balls. As our final dish we had _sweet pork bread_ which despite their name where really delicious and had a funny pig face form.

That night we slept really well, I don't know if it was because we had slept so much on Friday that the Jetlag was gone, or because the bed was a lot better at Fabien's than in the other place. What I do know is that for the first time since we arrived in Hong Kong we were able to sleep until 9am, and we woke up without any aches.

In the rest of sunday morning we went to the _Man Mo_ temple in the actual Hong Kong island. This is also an active temple, and dozens of people crowded the tiny space inside it. From the roof hanged inciense sticks in spiral form, and people was also burning inciense sticks and fake money which made the place full of smoke and gave it a mistical atmosphere. Very close to the temple was _Cat Street_, a small alley where antiques and second hand articles are sold. Just walking the street, and looking at all the stores and stalls is a real experience. Because it was close by, we went again to have lunch at _Tsim Chai Kee Noodles_.

After having lunch we did our usual crossing of the Bay by Ferry to go to the _Hong Kong Science Museum_, where we were in a continous race with the kids to use the attractions. The main attraction of the museum is an energy transformation machine that occupies the central space in the museum in its 3 floors, and that when is working makes all kind of noises while balls the size of bowling balls move around the whole structure speeding, falling and activating multiple devices for half an hour. We practically went back to being kids for almost 3 hours.

As a parting gift from Hong Kong we decided to have dinner again in our favorite place: _DimDimSum Dim Sum Specialty Store_, but this time in _Mongkok_  which was closer to Fabien's place. This time we had pineapple breads stuffed with pineapple conserve, followed by _Chau Siu Bao_ (BBQ stuffed bread), dumplings Shangai style stuffed with black truffle, and traditional _Siu Mai_ with codorniz eggs. For dessert we got again the _sweet pork bread_ which was as delicious as the first time. Everything was delicious and we left wanting to go back to taste the rest of the dishes of the menu.

Monday morning was already our last day on Hong Kong, we barely got some time to say good bye to Fabien, go out and do some shopping in a local market and prepare some scrambled eggs for breakfast before packing and going to the airport for our next destination: Hanoi.
