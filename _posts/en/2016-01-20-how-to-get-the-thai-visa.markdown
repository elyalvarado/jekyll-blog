One of the disadventages of traveling with our Venezuelean passport is that in many countries we're not allowed to get a Visa-on-Arrival, and instead we have to do the Visa paperwork before traveling.

Some countries, like Japan, don't allow you to get a Visa unless you're a legal resident or citizen of the country were you are getting it. When we decided no to get the Thai visa from Venezuela (because we had to send our passports to the Thai Embassy in Peru, and we didn't want to take that risk) we knew that it was possible that we couldn't get it anywhere else.

However, the reality was completely different. Despite having in the Thai Embassy in Hong Kong as one of the requisites for the Visa a copy of the HK Residency Card, the only requisites we needed to take where the vida form, a picture (3.5cm x 4.5cm), a passport copy, yellow fever certificate (it depends on your country of origin), and the only one we missed was a copy of the entrance stamp to HK in your passport. However, as of 2016 Hong Kong immigration authorities are not stamping your passport when you enter, instead they give you a printed piece of paper which we had to make a copy of.

If you have all the requisites, getting your visa is just about taking them one day in the morning to the Embassy, pay 300 HKD for each visa, and the next day go and get your passport.
