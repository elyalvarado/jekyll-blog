## The Arrival

We finally started our adventure, after a long trip, changing planes 4 times and flight through the north pole for 16 hours we arrived at our first destination: Hong Kong.

The appartment we rented using <a href="www.airbnb.com/c/ealvarado?s=8" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> is very little, it is probably smaller than 260 square feet, but it meets our basic requirements. It even has a kitchen to prepare something to eat. It is also very well located, close to Temple Street, but not that close as to be noisy, and just next to Austin subway station. Despite arriving very late in the night we went out to walk and do a little reconoissence of the zone, keep in mind that for our bodies it was just 11 in the morning.

After walking for a while around the Temple Street market, we bought some cup-a-noodle soups in a 7-eleven to cheat our bodies and get to sleep before what was going to be our first day traveling for one year.

## The first day
We woke up relatively early, and searched for supermarket close by to do some shopping. Luckily we had one just around the corner and we bought eggs, meat, pasta, bread and fruits for breakfast and lunch.

After that we returned to the appartment and made a good breakfast before starting to work. Around 1pm again the jetlag took the best of us, and despite setting the alarm to sleep only for one hour we ended up sleeping until 5pm when we finally got enough strength to wake up and search for a place to print the documents needed to process our Thai visa. We had to walk around half an hour before finding a place to print, but in the end we found it.

After printing the documents we started looking for a place to eat. We wanted to achieve a middle point between making our own food to save money and enjoying the most we could the local food, which was part of the cultural experience after all. In the same block of the appartment we noticed there was a Dim Sum restaurant with great reviews in TripAdvisor, so we choose that  place. Food there was great, we ate  _Siu Mai_ (Pork Dumplings with Crab Roe), meat and fried egg with steamed rice, bean curd wraps in mushroom soup, and noodles with vegetables. My favourite dish were the Siu Mai, but to my surprise Gaby liked a lot the bean curd wraps.

After having dinner we walked to the Hong Kong Bay to enjoy the city view before going to sleep.
